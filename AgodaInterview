I would like to use this space to say "Thank you for the occasion".
Sincerely thank you, I'm honored for this interview session. 
I haven't been learned about it before so, I think, I have to take time to study about it in the future. 
I will bring this experience to improve myself.
If I have learned, I think I can do this task. 
-Regards-
P. Panita
